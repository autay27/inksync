Hi there, I'm AU. I use fountain pens every day for taking notes and journaling. I like how stationery items acquire their own stories and personalities as you use them, and I decided to share some of my stories on this blog.

All photos are intended to give a general impression, not an accurate depiction, of the subject. They do not make a good reference, e.g. for the colour of ink.

I am based in the UK. You can contact me at goldgustwindfall@gmail.com.
