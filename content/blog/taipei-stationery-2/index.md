- Eslite Xinyi[^1] stationery store - Eslite is a spendy department store so I probably wouldn't get something here unless I couldn't find it anywhere else. To counterbalance this, they have loads of unusual and quality products here. Plus, they keep up with the trends - when I visited they had about a million different Travellers Notebook refills. There is a separate "Fine Writing" section which is a proper fountain pen shop, and similarly stocks a lot of trendy and unique stuff. Don't forget to check the giant 24/7 bookshop too. Note: Some other Eslite locations have stationery stores too, for example the one in Ximen.

[^1]: This one is actually closing, and the stationery and 24/7 bookshop will be moving to their Songyan location at the end of 2023. Be sure to go to the right place!


- TSUTAYA - A Japanese bookstore chain with a few locations in Taipei. Similar to Eslite, there is a good variety of unusual stuff, and it varies a lot depending on the location. For example, the Nangang location has a big Lamy store inside, while the one at Xinyi has some exclusive(?) Sailor and Tag inks.

- POYA - A chain store that sells everything (depending on the location). Usually has a good normal stationery section. In a larger one there will also be aesthetic journaling supplies (stickers, post its, washi tape etc - I always notice their little bags of ephemera for collages). I unexpectedly found some 2mm lead for my clutch pencil here. I've bought a lot of other things here too. POYA is very alluring...

- Your average big stationery shop (文具店）- These are everywhere. Just go and be awed by the sheer range, and cuteness, of stationery and knick knacks. Some may also stock DIY, electronics, and so on. You can get normal stationery items on a budget here (even by the standard of Taiwan prices) and can probably find something unique as well.

- 7-11 and similar - It's late at night, or maybe you came in to escape the afternoon heat. You don't even _want_ a pen, you just want to buy a drink, gum, hot dog, tea egg, toilet paper, shampoo, raincoat - you know, one of those things 7-11 has. Regardless, the stationery section will lure you in. The pens here are varied, high-quality, practical, and often unique. Don't waste your time looking at them! Go buy your drink!!!


Finally, if you're like me then you would want to keep an eye out for some Taiwanese fountain pen and ink brands which are not always found overseas (because otherwise... why not just get them back home?). Here is a list of the brands I've encountered / heard of. I will also mention what can be found in the UK since that's what I know, and perhaps gives an indicator of how likely they are to be found elsewhere.

Found in the UK: TWSBI, OPUS 88, YSTUDIO, Laban

Not found in the UK: 22STUDIO, SKB, IWI, FWI, Lennon Tool Bar, Ink Institute, HAPPYMT, Artex, Ty Lee, Taiwan Tenny, Mr. Cypress, Seeing Far

Have I missed anything? Let me know in the comments!
