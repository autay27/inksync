Recently I read _The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up_ by Marie Kondo. The book is famous for a reason---it is incredibly entertaining and gets you motivated to tidy up yourself. I am having some fun trying it out (although I'm not being as strict as recommended, so I won't be mad if my life isn't changed as a result). Following the order of categories listed in the book, I've tidied clothes, books and papers so far and haven't even touched my pens and art supplies. 

I decided that my unused notebooks come under the 'papers' category. I have hoarded quite a few because I want to try out the various fountain-pen-friendly papers as well as have some trusted ones ready to go. I've followed the KonMari philosophy and stored them upright; before, I had them stacked haphazardly on a shelf by my bed, which was neither pleasant to look at nor a good use of the space.

Now I can display them, see them every day and look forward to using them in the future. And hopefully it will remind me that I have plenty and don't need to buy more!

The container is made from a cardboard mini set of drawers, which I had never found a good use for before. I laid it flat and took out the drawers themselves, which will probably come in handy for storing small items. And yes, there is a third compartment which is empty, and I'm sure I'll find something to go in there too...

_Update: I now store my ebook reader in there between uses. It's around A6 size, so it looks just right in there._
