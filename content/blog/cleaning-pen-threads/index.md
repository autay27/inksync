Just a quick post about cleaning threads, such as the ones on pens with twist caps. They can collect dust and are too fine to be cleaned out with most items. The corner of a sheet of paper works in a pinch, but it's not super effective.

Today I realised that a paintbrush also works! I happened to have a watercolour brush on hand. It has fine and soft bristles so I don't need to worry about scratching the pen. Just push the bristles into the threads and flick the dust out.

Dust in the threads was a particular problem with my Sailor Pro Gear Slim, which (as I mentioned [when I bought it](blog/sailor-pgs-choice-and-impressions/)) shows up any dust immediately because it's white. I don't feel the need to keep my pens pristine, but it was bothering me that I couldn't clean the pen if I *wanted* to and that it was somehow permanently being defiled by my dusty little hands. I feel better after finding a way to clean it. 

Considering the section of the fountain pen community that likes to hunt down and restore vintage pens, not to mention all the other items with threads out there, I have no doubt that this (or an even better method) is already obvious to some people. But I've never heard it mentioned so I thought I'd share!
