I just filled out my first bullet journal in a few years! Let's share some photos and talk about what went well and what I'll change in the next one.

This was a Rymans A6 notebook, I think I got a pack of 3 for a pound. The small size was convenient for keeping out on a desk, as well as other reasons [I've talked about already](/blog/my-travelers-notebook/), but the uncoated paper was not great for fountain pens. It was nice to restart my bujo habit with something low-pressure and cheap though.

I don't follow the official bullet journal method. At the front of the book I have a planner and at the back I do rapid logging. Each gets a paperclip for a bookmark.

## Planner

This is usually a mixture of plans and notes on what happened each day. It's a quick way to record details of my life, without keeping a full daily journal.

I like making my own layouts. it is nice that I can effortlessly switch between 1-3 days per page based on my needs. I don't decorate them (they are an excuse to use lots of different coloured inks though).

I used this one in university when I had to plan meals and attend things on time. The vertical layout was inspired by Hobonichi Weeks (which I probably saw while watching one of Yoseka's lovely [planner tour videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbdTZ2nlAl8&pp=ygUTeW9zZWthIHBsYW5uZXIgdG91cg%3D%3D)).

I switched to page per day when [travelling this summer](https://inksync.goldgust.net/tags/taiwan/) because I wanted to record my memories in a bit more detail.

Nowadays my schedule is not packed, so my planner has become a simple daily to-do list.

## Logging

Like most young people I struggle with procrastination and smartphone addiction. Logging helps by giving me an analogue outlet for my thoughts. Rather than microblogging, I microlog.

I usually write about my current task so I can sort out my thoughts and stay focused on it (_"Need to write the timer logic next. I'll start by looking up Javascript Date methods"_), random thoughts (_"OMG [song name] is so good"),_ and observations (_"It's way too cold in this library"_).

Most importantly, **I log whenever I catch myself procrastinating**. This is a short easy task to do away from my phone and usually breaks me out of the procrastination. It also helps me spot the patterns of my own behaviour. I realised that I usually pick up my phone to escape when I am stuck on a problem. If I instead make a habit of **logging my frustration**, I'm more likely to calm down and try a different approach rather than going on my phone.

{{< figure src="rapidlog.jpg" alt="colourful writing" caption="Oh yeah, and I sometimes write down the time so I have a vague idea of how long I spent on different things. This can be a scary realisation." >}}

I don't need to read the log afterwards so I cram in entries separated by bullet points. A change in colour usually represents that some time has passed, but I only do that because it's fun to make the pages colourful.

At the moment, I only use the log when I'm sitting at a desk somewhere actively working on a project, but after writing about all the benefits I think maybe I should use it even more...

## The next one

I picked a Pistachio Life A6 notebook that I had saved up. I've never used this paper before but I know it is fountain pen friendly. Exciting!

I reworked my bullet system a bit with a new symbol for non-actionable notes.

This is because I've decided to aim for more positivity in the next bujo. In addition to tasks that need to be completed, I will start to record more already-completed tasks and good things from the day. I already do this in my digital notes sometimes but I want to turn it into a habit and do it on paper.

There were many periods this year when I stopped using my bullet journal altogether. There's nothing wrong with that, but I would prefer to be consistent so that more of my life gets recorded. Hopefully using it for positivity will encourage that.

Otherwise, I am happy with my system and looking forward to using it again in 2024!
