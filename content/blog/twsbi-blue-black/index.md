TWSBI Blue Black is a matte blue-black. It has an excellent flow and a slightly lubricated feeling. It works on cheaper paper without bleeding through too easily, even in a broad nib.

As part of TWSBI's basic ink range, it is available in 70ml bottles, at a good price per ml, although the size means it is still an investment. I bought mine for £15 after being intrigued by the [TGS review](https://www.gentlemanstationer.com/blog/2021/7/7/workhorse-inks-twsbi-blue-black).

When you open the weighty, chilly glass bottle of ink, you will notice the scent of iris[^1]. The fresh ink is a vibrant dark blue, but it quickly dries to its usual dusty colour. There is occasionally a slight inky smell while writing - if you have a sensitive nose, beware.

[^1]: Also known as the scent of boiling carrots and lipstick. I've never smelled either of those and only associate it with iris perfume.

This ink is strongly water-resistant. Even if I run my writing under the tap, it only blushes with a hint of excess blue pigment. TWSBI do not label it an iron gall ink - they seem to be confident the formulation will not damage pens - but the colour darkening, and the water-resistance, are characteristic of iron gall. I wonder if the iris scent comes from some chemical added to make the iron gall component more 'safe'.

There is subtle shading when writing with this ink, especially in a broader nib. Compared to a typical ink there is slightly more hue variation -  from lighter grey-blue to darker blue-purple. Just enough to create the illusion of vibrancy while remaining unobtrusive.

This is a classy ink. Distinctive if you're obsessed with colours and inks, blue-black to everyone else. This may be in TWSBI's basic ink lineup, but _basic_ here means _practical, versatile_.

## In use

At the moment, Twsbi Blue-Black is my favourite ink. (It's bumped Diamine Prussian Blue, another practical blue-black, into second place.) There is something satisfying about the matte permanence of it. And I am not usually a fan of shading per se, but it is my favourite thing about this ink. I like to use it in my journal, filling up pages with the delicate colour that doesn't look boring even next to bright accents.

Going by my current track record, 70ml of ink will last me about a decade. I say bring it on.
