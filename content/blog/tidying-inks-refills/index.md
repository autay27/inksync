As I mentioned [last time](/blog/tidying-notebooks), I've been doing some Marie Kondo-style tidying. In the last few days I finally reached the 'stationery' category in my tidying spree. 

The main issue: my inks, refills and supplies were distributed between an random assortment of cardboard boxes and sandwich bags. What's worse, these boxes and bags were in so many places in my room, they were dealing psychic damage every time I opened a drawer or a cupboard! They needed a tidying up ASAP! 

In the end it was surprisingly easy to consolidate them all into these three boxes.

I was lucky to have these clear plastic trays ready--they were drawers for a desk organiser where I really only needed the outside frame. They are pretty and let you easily see what you've got. The cardboard box on the right is from the drawer set I mentioned in my [tidying notebooks post](/blog/tidying-notebooks).

...Of course, this isn't _all_ the stuff I had. My next post will be about all the fountain pen-related items I am letting go.

## A closer look

As I complained on Mastodon, there seems to be no good way to display ink bottles. Especially knowing I'll view them in a drawer from above, it's like playing Tetris with all the wrong pieces.

This will do for now. Bonus: I'm motivated to use up my samples because they look like clutter compared to the big pretty bottles.

All my ink cartridges and pen refills are inside the grey box, plus the small ring box with my spare fountain pen nibs. Outside in the clear tray are supplies like my ink syringes, silicone grease, and micromesh board.

I had forgotten about the nibs in that ring box and it was a big win for me when I realised I had a Lamy EF which was just right for using in my work bullet journal.

This old Lamy pen box fit all my pencil leads, plus spare erasers, so well that I got unreasonably excited. Stationery! Yay!! 

By the way, pencil leads were the #1 thing I kept finding in random places while tidying. I am looking forward to using more of them now I know I have them.

## Bonus: pen sleeves

I put all my pen sleeves into this pencil case which I didn't like on its own (too floppy), and I find it so cute to see them all snuggled together. I only use pen sleeves when transporting pens or bringing a single one out somewhere, which I haven't been doing recently, so they are happy to be in storage until I need them again.
