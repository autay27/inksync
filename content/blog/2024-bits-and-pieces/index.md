My life got busier, so I've been racking up topics to write about, as well as totally failing to set aside time for writing. Here is a quick roundup of all the topics.

### Purposely taking a break from a pen

I enjoy a bit of self-denial and since I didn't bring my Pilot Custom 74 F on my [summer travels](blog/taipei-stationery-1/), I used that as an excuse to put it away for maybe 6 months. I delayed longer and longer while looking forward to it more and more. In the end it wasn't *that* exciting to pick it back up again, but it didn't slip down from my #1 favourite spot either. It's the same slippery, delicate, beautifully proportioned pen as always.

### Giving a pen and ink a second chance

A few months back I was [whining about how the TWSBI GO makes my hand hurt](blog/twsbi-go) and I wanted to sell it. I couldn't find a buyer so it sat in my drawer until recently, when I pulled it out at random and filled it with Diamine Chocolate Brown, an ink I don't even like the colour of (I've tried and failed to give this one away too).

I don't know if it's because it's a very lubricating ink or because I've changed my habits somehow, but writing with the GO doesn't hurt my hand anymore, and I like how it makes Chocolate Brown look too! A double redemption.

### A new reason to use my stationery

I started my first job, and naturally that means I started my first work bullet journal. I am still using the bullet journaling system from my [last post](blog/bujo-2023) and it is working very well for me.

The notebook I chose for this job was not super fountain pen-friendly, but it was the only A5-ish one I could find in the house at the time. It was mostly full already - I'm about to finish and move on to my next one, an Oxford A5 ring bound... again, the only suitable one I could find laying around. I am not sure what my ideal notebook for this purpose would be, although the white Midori Color comes to mind. I've already filled one as a journal before.

### Pen cases

This summer I bought a Kokuyo 'slish' pencil case. It's good for taking out and about because you do not need to unzip anything to take out or put away your pen. I will do a full post about mine another time, when it has developed a bit more of its own "story". Nevertheless, I can already recommend it if you want a pencil case that's minimalist but still a little quirky.

Another thing I bought back then was a tfdesign 5-pen case (which I did [post a picture of on Mastodon](https://sunny.garden/@inksync/110870438425891413)). It's been handy for me to leave open on my desk and, more recently, to transport a bunch of pens at once. But when I left my pale blue Lamy Safari clipped onto the inner section, the brown leather stained the plastic under the clip... So, that's a minor horror story. The leather is thick and not designed for clips in the first place.

### Custom notebooks?

I hand-bound my first sketchbook. It was a nice tactile experience, sewing with a thick blunt needle and a sturdy linen thread, and it was surprisingly easy to turn those loose sheets of paper into something useful and aesthetically appealing. The sketchbooks I can find in art supply stores don't suit my needs these days, and I'm excited to bind more of my own going forward. (I'm lucky because I have a thing for single-signature notebooks, the easiest kind to bind.)

I wonder if I can bind my own own fountain pen-friendly notebooks as well? It seems less novice-friendly - thinner paper and I would have less tolerance for wrinkles or misaligned lines/grids. But the payoff would be amazing if I could use different specialty papers without having to shell out or accept their particular notebook formats. Something to keep in mind for the future.

### Photography!?

Apart from the first one, all the images in this post were taken with a DSLR camera and macro lens[^1] which I am lucky enough to be borrowing. I'm a mega novice who has only used a point-and-shoot camera before, but it's already a relief to be able to get such a wide depth of field and to use manual focus without my phone's finicky touch screen. I'm tempted to get my own DSLR since I do enjoy photography... and it would vastly improve the photos on this blog... We'll see!
